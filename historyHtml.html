    <h1 id="Home">HTML - HyperText Markup Language</h1>
    <h2>1993 - Present</h2>
    <p>
        The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different
        versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official
        standard in December 1999.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used
        to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup
        Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication).

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Sir_Tim_Berners-Lee_%28cropped%29.jpg/330px-Sir_Tim_Berners-Lee_%28cropped%29.jpg"

    <p>
        Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA DFBCS RDI (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is an
        English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, the URL
        system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a professor emeritus
        at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
    </p>
    <h3>Early life and education</h3>
    <p>
        Berners-Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England,[24] the eldest of the four children of Mary Lee Woods
        and Conway Berners-Lee; his brother Mike is a professor of ecology and climate change management. His parents
        were computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1.
    </p>

    <h3>Career and research</h3>
    <p>
        After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole,
        Dorset.[24] In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for
        printers.[24]

    </p>
    <p>
        Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed
        a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among
        researchers.[27] To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.[28]
    </p>
    <p>
        After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth,
        Dorset.[29] He ran the company's technical side for three years.[30] The project he worked on was a "real-time
        remote procedure call" which gave him experience in computer networking.[29] In 1984, he returned to CERN as a
        fellow.
    </p>
    <h4>Awards & Honors</h4>
    <p>
        Berners-Lee has received many awards and honours. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2004 New Year
        Honours "for services to the global development of the Internet", and was invested formally on 16 July
        2004.[20][21]
    </p>
    <p>
        On 13 June 2007, he was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM), an order restricted to 24 (living) members.[68]
        Bestowing membership of the Order of Merit is within the personal purview of the Sovereign and does not require
        recommendation by ministers or the Prime Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2001.[69] He was also elected as a member into the
        American Philosophical Society in 2004[70] and the National Academy of Engineering in 2007.
    </p>

    <p>
        He has been conferred honorary degrees from a number of universities around the world, including Manchester (his
        parents worked on the Manchester Mark 1 in the 1940s), Harvard and Yale.[71][72][73]
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2012, Berners-Lee was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new
        version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover – to
        celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday.[74][75]
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2013, he was awarded the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering.[76] On 4 April 2017, he received
        the 2016 ACM Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental
        protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".[22]

    <h2 id="Development">Development of HTML</h2>
    <h3>HTML 2</h3>
    <h4>November 24, 1995</h4>
    <p>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
    <ul>
        <li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>
        <li>May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)</li>
        <li>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</li>
        <li>January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>HTML 3</h3>
    <h4>January 14, 1997</h4>
    <p>
        HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized
        exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16]
        Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various
        proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and
        Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for
        mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>HTML 4</h3>
    <h4>December 18, 1997</h4>
    <p>
        HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
    <ul>
        <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
        <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
        <li>Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
    </ul>
    Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also
    sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4
    is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.
    </p>
    <h4>April 24, 1998</h4>
    <p>HTML 4.0[20] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.</p>
    <h4>December 24, 1999</h4>
    <p>HTML 4.01[21] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last
        errata[22] were published on May 12, 2001.</p>
    <h4>May 2000</h4>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15445:2000[23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international
        standard.[24] In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical
        Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).
    </p>
    <p>
        After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel,
        XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>HTML 5</h3>
    <h4>October 28, 2014</h4>
    <p>
        HTML5[25] was published as a W3C Recommendation.

    </p>
    <h4>November 1, 2016</h4>
    <p>
        HTML 5.1[27] was published as a W3C Recommendation.
    </p>
    <h4>December 14, 2017</h4>
    <p>
        HTML 5.2[30] was published as a W3C Recommendation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="More">Examples of types of content that can be included on web pages</h2>
    <p>
        The following table shows a list of many of the types of content that can be added to web pages using different
        versions of HTML. In the early days of the Web, HTML (version 1.2) was very simple, but over time new versions
        were released that added more and more features. Still, if web designers wanted to add content or features that
        HTML didn't support, they would have to do so with non-standard proprietary technologies such as Adobe Flash.
